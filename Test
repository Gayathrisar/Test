 The 6 main characteristics of blockchain:

The key blockchain features

*Capacity. This is one of the most important features of blockchain.
*Immutability. This is another important attribute of blockchain.
*Decentralization. 
*Distributed ledger technology (DLT) 
*Consensus.
*Quick settlement.
 type of chain block:

Chain block is a hand operated device that is able to lift or lower loads. Two type of chain blocks, DS and DH, are available with different capacities and net weight. Both series can be provided in stainless steel or explosion proof version.
 the two types of chain block

There are two main types of chain pulley blocks: manual and electric. Manual chain pulley blocks are operated by hand, while electric chain pulley blocks are powered by electricity. Manual chain pulley blocks are ideal for lifting lighter loads and are commonly used in small shops and garages.
